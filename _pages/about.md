Hi, this is KJ.

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at School ofCommunication, University of Technology Sydney, and a member of the Center for Future Media & Human-Machine Communication, supervised by Dr. Paul Bron, Dr. Kai Lin & A/Prof. Amelia Johns.

Before joining in UTS, I also got my Bachelor of Communication (Honours) in Media and Communication Studies at Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Bapist University (Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Runze Ding).

You can download my CV, or browse this website for more info.
