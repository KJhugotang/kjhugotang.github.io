I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculties/design-and-society/communication" style="color: #226b68; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">School of Communication, University of Technology Sydney</a>, supervised by Dr. Paul Bron, Dr. Kai Lin & A/Prof. Amelia Johns.
